// Final Project: A controller is a thing that controls a player - i.e. either
// a UI or an AI.  Your controller will be in its own project (instructions
// for that are in the assignment), but will inherit from this and implement
// all of the pure virtual functions.  The game will call those functions when
// it is time for the controler to do its work.
